# PI-Rasp-Franken-Berry
Merged GPIO Raspberry code used for an Android app into my webpage.
I needed to make an Andoid app https://pirelay.jasonfindlay.com/ that performed without failure work for my websites index page.
Should have called it PI Frankenberry because I Frankensteined diffenent codes into my application. Never have done anything like this and guessed at some until I struck paydirt. WHAT A RUSH.
